# Object Detection in an Urban Environment



## Submission Template

### Project overview
This section should contain a brief description of the project and what we are trying to achieve. Why is object detection such an important component of self driving car systems?
This project aim to establish object detection for a self driving car by training model then validate to be able to detect car and people
object detection is really important for self driving system because it rely on the ability to recognize and avoid obstacle in real time with help of LIDAR, radar and cameras to detect and identify objects




### Set up
This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.
Step 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The ipynb file can found in Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb
The 10 Desired output of the display_images function are in images file as
images/Step1-1
images/Step1-2
images/Step1-3
images/Step1-4
images/Step1-5
images/Step1-6
images/Step1-7
images/Step1-8
images/Step1-9
images/Step1-10

Step2 - Edit the config file
The config file can be found under (pipeline_new.config) and (pipeline.config)

Step 3 - Model Training and Evaluation
expriment graph (Loss chart) can be found under images/Step 3 Loss

Step 4- Step 4 - Improve the performances
The ipynb file can found in Explore augmentations.ipynb


### Dataset
Front Camera Images from Waymo Open Dataset. Data are in TFRecord Format, the TFRecord format is a simple format for storing a sequence of binary records, which helps in data reading and processing efficiency.

### Training
Some training has been made with different config
